# Keybase

Some time back i used to have my PGP key registered on MIT pgp server http://pgp.mit.edu/. It's one of the largest public directory for PGP keys, but it's kind of old fashnioned and attracts mostly the academic world.

I'm not entirely sure how i come to find http://keybase.io but it seems a new interesting way to get PGP to the general audience.

It allows, as the slogan say:

> Keybase maps your identity to your public keys, and vice versa.

In order to be a trully trusted PKI the registration is done by invitation only which seems interesting in order to maintain some sort of quality assurance, but will make the evolution a lot slower.

So basically this allows you to associate your domain, twitter account, github account,etc with you keys.

It also has it's own distributed filesystem KBFS.

Now this, seems to me, like the most important factor on this solution. Because you can quickly access other people keys, trust them, and follow you know friends.

I still have some invites left, in case you are interested drop me an email :)

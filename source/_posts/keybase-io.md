# Keybase

Some time back i used to have my pgp registerd on MIT pgp server http://pgp.mit.edu/. It's one of the largest public directory for PGP keys, but it's kind of old fanisoned and attacts mostly the academic world.

I'm not entirely sure how i come to find http://keybase.io but it seems a new interesting way to get PGP to the general audience.

It allows you as the slogan say:

> Keybase maps your identity to your public keys, and vice versa.

In order to a trully trusted PKI the registration is done by invitation only which seems interesting in order to maintain some sort of quality assurance, but will make the evolution a lot slower.

So basically this allows you to register your domain, twitter account, github account,etc with you keys.

It also has it's own distributed filesystem KBFS.

Now this, seems to me like the most important factor on this solution.

I still have some invites left, in case you are interested drop me an email :)
